# Firmware_PenTest

Firmware Insight is a comprehensive tool for analyzing firmware files. It automates the following tasks:

- Extracting files based on known signatures.
- Generating hexdumps.
- Attempting to decrypt the firmware if encrypted.
- Scanning for known CVEs based on extracted file information.
- Scanning for sensitive information in extracted files.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/firmware_insight.git
   cd firmware_insight
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Or run the installation script:

```bash
./install.sh
```

## Usage

Run the tool with the following command:

```bash
python3 firmware_analysis.py <binary_file> -o <output_directory>
```

### Example

To analyze a firmware binary and save extracted files to the output directory:

```bash

python3 firmware_analysis.py firmware.bin -o output
```

### Features

1. File Extraction: Extracts embedded files from the firmware based on known signatures.
2. Hexdump Generation: Generates hexdumps of extracted files.
3. Decryption: Attempts to decrypt firmware files using common keys and IVs.
4. CVE Scanning: Scans for known vulnerabilities using the CIRCL CVE API.
5. Sensitive Information Scanning: Scans extracted files for sensitive keywords like passwords, tokens, and secrets.
